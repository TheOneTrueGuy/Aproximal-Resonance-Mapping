# Jabberwocky Manifold Definition Prompts
# =====================================
# These prompts define the behavioral manifold for Lewis Carroll-style
# nonsense literature. They are structured to trigger desired behaviors
# (attractors) and define boundaries (undesired behaviors).
#
# Structure:
# - Attractors: Instructions that trigger nonsense/playful behaviors
# - Boundaries: Instructions for straightforward/technical writing
# - Transitions: Hybrid prompts combining elements

# ================================

# ================================
# Additional boundary examples to ensure clear separation

# ================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ================================
#
# This manifold defines ~50 behavioral points spanning:
# - Dense attractor regions (nonsense/playful writing)
# - Sparse boundary regions (technical/straightforward writing)
# - Transition zones (hybrid styles)
#
# For ARM analysis:
# 1. Use all prompts as seeds for manifold mapping
# 2. The system will automatically identify attractors vs boundaries
# 3. Probe responses around each seed will define local structure
# 4. Topological clustering will reveal the manifold topology
# 5. Result: Steering capability toward Jabberwocky-style generation
#
# Expected emergent properties:
# - Attractors form dense clusters in behavioral space
# - Boundaries create sparse, isolated regions
# - Clear topological separation between nonsense vs. technical writing
# - Multi-dimensional control surface for style interpolation
