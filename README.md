# Aproximal Resonance Mapping
A Latent Space Topological Generalization of Linear Algorithmic Tomography

ARM/ApReMap maps a modelâ€™s latent manifold by:

(1) probing local neighborhoods with proximal ensembles of directions, 

(2) measuring resonance spectra (co-activation / mode structure) across probes, and 

(3) building a topological graph/field of attractors and transitions using spectral and persistent-homology tools. 

The result is a control surface richer than single linear control vectors as might be found in Representation Engineering.

Swap out your one-dimensional Control Vectors for rich, poly-dimensional Control Manifolds.
